- background -> look up papers tackling same/similar problems, summarize the findings in those papers and the general state-of-the-art when it comes to character-level RNN
- theory -> write about the architecture of RNNs and LSTMs, how and when they are used and how they work
- code -> change pytorch tutorial to work with new data set
- extension -> change code to work with LSTM
- extension -> change code to work with GRU
- extension -> try more hidden layers
